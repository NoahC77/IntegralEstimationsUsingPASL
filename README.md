# IntegralEstimationsUsingPASL
This project currently includes a rough Simpson's rule integral estimation program. In the future more methods of integral estimation will be included along with error calculations, however currently the project only includes the Simpson method estimation. The goal of this project is to study the performance of estimations of varying functions and to optimize them along with making the program decently user friendly. The main goal is just to have fun with programming no linearly and playing with math, so the focus of the project could really change at any time. The focus of the project may change, but the project is tied to PASL which stands for Parallel Algorithm Scheduling Library and is prenounced like (PASOLE). 						  PASL's github: https://github.com/deepsea-inria/pasl/tree/wedu											    This project also uses the Symbolicc++ library to differentiate functions and exprtk.								      Symbolicc++: symboliccpp.sourceforge.net														        exprtk: https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk														  Lastly this project uses the c++11 atomic class to prevent race conditions.

## Getting Started
Because this project relies so heavily on the previously mentioned libraries, make sure you have all the dependencies for each library. I probably shouldve mentioned this much sooner, but PASL only runs on Unix. On another note I am working on this on linuxmint-19.1-cinnamon 64 bit. Other than that you should be able to simply download the code and get to editing.

## TODO
-Take in user specified functions
-Make function to calculate possible error given 'n'.
-Finish README.md :              ^)
